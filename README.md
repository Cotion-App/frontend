# Cotion Frontend
> Convert your Canvas assignments to Notion tasks

## Overview
The website is a single page application built using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that forms the frontend when users go to [cotion.herokuapp.com](cotion.herokuapp.com). It is written in JavaScript, and uses TailwindCSS for styling. 

## Running Locally
### Requisite Software
- Node.js (any recent version should work)
- Installation of npm (node package manager)

After cloning the repo to your local machine, run the following lines of code in the repo folder:

```
npm i
````
This installs all dependencies and stores them in a folder called `node_modules`. This only needs to be run once.

Then to start a local instance of the frontend, run:

```
npm start
```

The app should be viewable at `localhost:3000`.
